## Known problems

### General

* If a filename has some nasty characters in it, the file is ignored.

### Linux

* On Linux, the pre-listen function only plays music if there is no other audio source active on the system.

### Mac OS X

* If the software does not start on Mac OS X systems due to security or certificate constraints, one can either lower the Java security setting under the 'Security' tab of the Java settings, or open the program via the right mouse button and the 'Open' command.

### Microsoft Windows

* On the first start of the program a security warning might occur due to missing digital signature. If the program has been downloaded from the official website it can be ignored. To start the program anyway click on 'Run anyway', or 'More Information' and then the 'Run' button, depending on your Windows version.
